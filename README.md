# Project Proposal

## Project title - Sorting Visualizer


Group members: Owen Cozine and Ermias Merine

### What and why?

I want to build a website that lets you visually see a sorting algorithm in action. This could help a lot of people who are trying to learn about sorting algorithms better understand how they run. This website would allow them to increase or decrease the data that needs to be sorted, and pick what type of sorting algorithm they want to see run.
  
### For whom?

This website is mant for anyone interested in learning sorting algorithms

### How?

The users choose the sorting algo they want to learn about, and then read about the algorithm, see the code for it, and watch how it works in a clear and easy to follow animation.

### Scope

This project is relatively simple to understand but a bit tricky to implement. In terms of scope it's pretty flexable due to the fact that a small number or a large number of sorting algorithms can be implemented. Every member of our group would be given a minimum of 1 sorting algorithm to implement up to however many they want to implement. If theres enough time we could even expand the entire project to include a visualizer for path finding algorithms.
