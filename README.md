# Project Proposal

##Project title - Sorting Visualizer


###What and why?

I want to build a website that lets you visually see a sorting algorithm in action. This could help a lot of people who are trying to learn about sorting algorithms better understand how they run. This website would allow them to increase or decrease the data that needs to be sorted, and pick what type of sorting algorithm they want to see run.
  
###For whom?

This website is mant for anyone interested in learning sorting algorithms

###How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

###Scope

This project is relatively simple to understand but a bit tricky to implement. In terms of scope it's pretty flexable due to the fact that a small number or a large number of sorting algorithms can be implemented. Every member of our group would be given a minimum of 1 sorting algorithm to implement up to however many they want to implement. If theres enough time we could even expand the entire project to include a visualizer for path finding algorithms.
